# 🚀 E-commerce Operations Enhancement through Predictive Modeling and Churn Classification 📊

## 🌐 Executive Summary

This project delves into a comprehensive data analysis of the Olist Store dataset, encompassing 100,000 orders from the Brazilian e-commerce platform between 2016 and 2018. The objective is to gain insights that enhance the understanding of e-commerce operations. The focus is on identifying and retaining actively engaged customers, achieved by excluding records with missing delivery dates and utilizing selective imputation strategies.

## 🔮 Predictive Modeling

We explored random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression algorithms for model building. The random forest model emerged as the most promising, achieving 67% accuracy and an AUC score of 0.727. This ensemble method reduced overfitting and increased predictive power, making it suitable for our predictive modeling assignment.

## 📊 RFM Analysis

Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) analysis is employed to understand customer behavior. A churn prediction model using Recency as the target variable categorizes customers exceeding the average Recency as 'churned.' This aids in foreseeing potential churners and implementing proactive strategies for customer retention.

## 🌍 Discovery and Data Preparation

The dataset, originating from the Brazilian e-commerce system, underwent thorough cleaning and preparation. We focused on finalizing orders and created key columns for analysis. Exploring the distribution of order status and considering geographical factors, logistics challenges, and payment processes, we prepared the data for modeling.

## 🚀 Model Planning and Building

Understanding market trends by state and city in Brazil, we aimed to predict growth areas and target marketing resources accordingly. We observed a significant increase in e-commerce sales from January to July 2018 and identified key regions for corporate expansion. Analyzing product categories revealed insights into customer preferences and potential growth areas.

## 📈 Results and Performance

Three models—logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest—were built and evaluated. The random forest model outperformed the others with an accuracy of 66.43% and an AUC score of 0.7296. This model demonstrated robust predictive capabilities and identified intricate patterns in the data.

## 💬 Discussion and Recommendations

To enhance future analyses, we recommend segmenting the analysis per major market, focusing on consumer behavior, and improving ongoing model monitoring for adaptability. Emphasis should be placed on enhancing features contributing to predictive power, addressing weak points in the fulfillment network, and optimizing marketing strategies based on regional sales volume and average payment per order.
